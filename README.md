## Usage
Writen in ES6.  Create instances of each data structure by importing only the class you want.
For example: ```import { LinkedList } from 'data-structures';``` 
The spirit behind this project is to allow the use of classic data structures within Javascript applications, and to allow the storage of non-primitive data types such as objects, functions, arrays, and even other instances of any kind of data structures (like a Linked List tree within a Graph).  To accomplish this, most of the data structures here use an __id in place of the value for reference.  

### test: run mocha
