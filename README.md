## Usage
Create instances of each data structure by importing only the class you want.
For example: ```var BinaryTree = require('data-structures-javascript').BinaryTree``` 
The spirit behind this project is to allow the use of classic data structures within Javascript applications, and to allow the storage of data types such as objects, functions, arrays, and even other instances of any kind of data structures (like a Linked List within a Graph).  To accomplish this, most of the data structures here use an __id in place of the value for reference.  

## NPM Install
```npm install data-structures-javascript```
Then, in your Javascript files: ```var DataStructures = require('data-structures-javascript')``` ```var BinaryTree = DataStructures.BinaryTree```


## Classes
- BinaryTree
- Graph
- LinkedList
- Queue
- Stack
